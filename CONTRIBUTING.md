Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process straightforward and effective for everyone involved.

## Core Ideas

As much as possible, we try to keep the process of creating Express.js applications simple and hassle-free. This means that we prioritize the following principles:

1. **Simplicity:** The primary goal of Create Express App Js is to provide an easy-to-use CLI tool for generating Express.js applications. We aim to keep the process straightforward and minimize configuration requirements.

2. **Ease of Use:** We prioritize conventions and interactivity over complex configurations. By leveraging conventions and providing interactive features, we strive to make the development experience as smooth as possible for users.

### Breaking the Rules

While we typically avoid adding configuration options or flags, there may be cases where it becomes necessary to introduce them. In such cases, we carefully consider the value they bring and aim to minimize complexity wherever possible.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.
